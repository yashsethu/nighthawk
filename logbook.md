# Nighthawk 
Nighthawk is a budget, beginner friendly core-xy printer made based on the Apogee toolhead for Voron 

## Planning
Desired specifications:
- 300 x 300 x 300 build volume
- Core-xy design, with linear rails for all axes and lead screws for z-axis screws
- Apogee toolhead (Orbiter v2, Phaetus Dragonfly BMS, CRTouch)
- Klipper run on a Raspberry Pi 4B
- Enclosed in a polycarb shell (1/8 inch thick?)

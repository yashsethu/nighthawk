The Nighthawk is a crazy fast, crazy cool Voron 0.2 (not really) for brokies! Featuring an improved toolhead with CRTouch/BLTouch, a redesign of the frame, Z-axis, and gantry (everything) and a less flashy bed assembly!

## Why choose a Nighthawk?
Why the heck would you try to build one of these? Well, if you're thinking any of the following, let's get to it!
- I am broke
- I am lazy and impatient. I want my prints done FAST. With a Z axis mounted for stability and a toolhead designed for SPEEEEEED, this will likely print a sub 5 minute benchy.
- I don't have space. Designed to fit in a 215x215x250 mm square with rigidity, I'll build this and save space.
- I want consistent and industry-standard mesh compensation. With BLTouch and CRTouch compatability, I don't have to deal with the rarer and less-documented calibration devices the Voron 0.2 supports.
- I want a clear CAD design for my printer. Instead of using a series of obscure STEP files, or even god forbid STL files in CAD, I will have clear documentation on the structure and shape of the printer online!
- I want a more modern toolhead. Using a Sherpa Mini with a modern Apogee framework, this toolhead will acheive crazy flowrates and speeds without too much cost

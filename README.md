The Nighthawk is a crazy fast, crazy cool Voron 0.2 (not really) for brokies! Featuring an improved toolhead with CRTouch/BLTouch, a redesign of the frame, Z-axis, and gantry (everything) and a less flashy bed assembly!

## Why choose a Nighthawk?
Why the heck would you try to build one of these instead of heading over to the Voron site? Well, if you're thinking any of the following, let's get to it!
- I am broke and don't want to spend 600$ on a Voron 0.2 kit. I would rather build a similar one for 300$
- I am lazy and impatient. I want my prints done FAST. With a Z axis mounted for stability and a toolhead designed for SPEEEEEED, this will likely print a sub 5 minute benchy.
- I don't have space. Instead of having a giant tophat and even more unneccesarily large skirts, I'll build this and save space.
- I want consistent and industry-standard mesh compensation. With BLTouch and CRTouch compatability, I don't have to deal with the rarer and less-documented calibration devices the Voron 0.2 supports.
- I want a clear CAD design for my printer. Instead of using a series of obscure STEP files, or even god forbid STL files in CAD, I will have clear documentation on the structure and shape of the printer online!
